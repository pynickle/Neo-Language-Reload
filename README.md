## Description

This is an unofficial Neoforge port of [Language Reload](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/language-reload), dedicated to maintaining all the features of the original mod and ensuring compatibility.

Language Reload is a Fabric mod that adds quality of life changes related to languages.

### Features

* Fast language switching without resource pack reloading
* A search box in the language menu
* Multiple language selection (Each translation in a language overrides translations from languages below.)
* Multilingual item search (Enables searching in any of selected languages in the creative inventory and the recipe book. This feature can be disabled in the mod options accessible via Mod Menu or directly in the mod config file.)
* Automatic language detection if there is no "lang:" in options.txt
* Reloading languages with F3 + J and cycling them with Shift + F3 + J

### Development

I will try to keep it synchronized with the original mod version, so please be patient.

### Compatibility

#### Modern UI

Open the Modern UI configuration screen and disable the Use Text Component Cache option in the Text Layout section.
